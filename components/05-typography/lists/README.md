## Implementation

Lists are styled by default. For unstyled lists, use either the `vgr-unstyled-list` class or unstyled list mixin: `@include unstyled-list;`.

## Usability

### When to use

* Use an ordered list when you need to display text in some ranking, hierarchy, or series of steps.
* Use unordered lists to display text in no specific order.

### When to consider something different

* If you need to communicate long lists of narrative text.

### Guidelines

* Use sentence case and begin lists with a capital letter.
* Use punctuation appropriate to the text. Do not leave sentences without periods.
